USAGE...      Motor driver support for the SmarAct MCS2 controller.

Note:
The MCS2 controller uses 64-bit int for the encoder and target positions. The motor record is limited
to 32 bit int for RMP (https://github.com/epics-modules/motor/issues/8,
https://epics.anl.gov/tech-talk/2018/msg00087.php) which effectively limits the travel
range to +/- 2.1mm.
Since it doesn't seem the motor record will update to using 64bit int the choices I can see are:
* 1 - using a non-standard motor support
* 2 - rescaling the minimum resolution to 1nm to effectively increase the range to 2.1m

I chose option 2.
1 step = 1nm

Someone with more experience may have a better solution.

Note on controller capability:
The controller supports many more sophisticated features than are supported in this driver.
The two that may be of significant interest are:
  * TTL triggering at specified positions
  * "scan" mode where the piezo stick slip can flex up to 1.6micron to give
     very precise and fast motion
